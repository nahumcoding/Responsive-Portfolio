      <h2>Nahum Sonck</h2>

      <img id="imag" src="imag.jpg"> 

      <p>Hi, my name is Nahum Sonck and I was born and raised in Miami, FL. My family originates from Mexico and I was brought up in a Latino household. Since I was 10 years old my father brought me into the family business and showed me how to work. He enstilled discipline and work ethic while showing me the ropes of the business, hence I've lived a humble hard working life. My father taught me values such as right from wrong and that no matter what, family is sacred. I do however enjoy going out with friends from time to time and extracurricular activities such as sports and hiking. I also enjoy lifting weights and working out as it contributes to a healthy lifestyle.    <a href="http://www.lipsum.com/">www.lipsum.com</a></p>
